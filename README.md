# Hi,![176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e](https://github.com/ShahabAthar25/ShahabAthar25/assets/83354141/6fc9430d-a39e-43e5-8f25-f8d44c81e280) My name is Sajawal Hassan

Hello, I am Shahab Athar, a teenager with a passion for coding. In my four-plus years of experience, I have created numerous projects and acquired various skills. My projects range from custom programming languages to computer vision to web development.

I began my coding journey at the age of 14, initially focusing on Python and backend development. I started by learning GUI libraries like PyQt5 and Tkinter, followed by Django. Additionally, I have developed several computer vision projects, including face recognition systems. Currently, my expertise lies in Django, ReactJS, NextJS, and TypeScript. Over the past three years, I have honed my web development skills and have achieved the status of a full-stack developer by the age of 18.

I can be a valuable asset to your company, as I have completed multiple projects with real-world applications and complexities comparable to professional standards. I have created various clones, including a Google Docs clone, a Gmail clone, and a Twitter clone. I developed a website and backend for an event called CRSOM for a university in my hometown of Multan, Pakistan. In summary, I take pride in my coding abilities and am confident in my capacity to deliver results. I am eager to be a significant asset to your company, transforming your digital visions into reality.
